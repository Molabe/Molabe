👋 Hi there! I'm **Molabe** — that's the name most people know me by in the gaming and development communities.

🎓 I'm currently a student at **SSOŠ in Nitra**, where I study **programming**. My main focus is on languages and technologies like **Java**, **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **SQL**.

💻 In my free time, I enjoy diving deeper into web development with **React**, styling with **Bootstrap**, and building fun and functional **Discord bots using Discord.js**.

I'm always looking to learn new things and work on interesting projects — feel free to check out my repositories!
